# Dominos-Score-Keeper
A score keeping game that I created for my girlfriend and I to help us keep score while playing Dominos. One of us would always have to have a sheet of paper to keep the score on, so I figured that I would create a GUI for this task. I have created this in Python already, but I made it in Java now.
